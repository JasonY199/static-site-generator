# static-site-generator
Static site generator from scratch, similar to Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby in Python.

# How to run

#### Use Python's built-in HTTP server to serve the contents of the public directory:

```bash
cd public
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

Open your browser and paste in the URL of your server, (http://localhost:8888) into the address bar.

## Personal notes

* Run `chmod +x main.sh` to make `main.sh` executable
* **Run** `./main.sh` to run main file
* Run `chmod +x test.sh` to make `test.sh` executable
* **Run** unit tests with this command: `./test.sh`
